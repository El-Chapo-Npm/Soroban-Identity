# Soroban Identity Server

Operational HTTP API server for Soroban Identity smart contracts. It exposes metrics, admin issuer management, and credential expiry tracking.

## Usage

### Run the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Configuration

The server configuration can be customized using the following environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | HTTP port the server listens on. | `3001` |
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Key for authenticating request calls on `/admin/*` endpoints. | unset |
| `DATA_DIR` | Directory path for local file storage. | `./data` |
| `AUDIT_LOG_PATH` | Base file path prefix used for daily rotated audit logs. | `[DATA_DIR]/audit` |
| `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | Number of days to retain rotated audit logs. | `30` |
| `CREDENTIAL_STORE_PATH` | Storage location for credential records. | `[DATA_DIR]/credentials.json` |

## Audit Log Naming & Rotation

The system generates a new, separate audit log file for each day. The log files are stored in Newline Delimited JSON (NDJSON) format.

### Log File Naming
The log file name is derived by appending the current UTC date to the base log path prefix:
`audit-YYYY-MM-DD.ndjson`

* Day 1 logs are written to `audit-YYYY-MM-Day1.ndjson`.
* Day 2 logs are written to `audit-YYYY-MM-Day2.ndjson`.

### Cleanup & Retention
Every time the server starts, it scans the logs folder and deletes any rotated log files that are older than `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` days (default is 30 days) to prevent disk space exhaustion.
